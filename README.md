# Experiment-4

Aim:

The aim of this program is to demonstrate the bitwise operations and shifts in C++ using predefined integer values for variables a and b.

Theory:

In the provided C++ program: Variables Initialization: a is initialized to 5 (int a = 5;). b is initialized to 3 (int b = 3;).

Bitwise Operations: AND (a & b): Performs a bitwise AND operation between a and b. Result is 1 (binary 101 & 011). OR (a | b): Performs a bitwise OR operation between a and b. Result is 7 (binary 101 | 011). XOR (a ^ b): Performs a bitwise XOR operation between a and b. Result is 6 (binary 101 ^ 011). NOT (~a): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a. Result is -6 (bitwise complement of 5). LEFT SHIFT (a << b): Shifts bits of a left by b positions. Result is 40 (binary 101 << 3). RIGHT SHIFT (a >> b): Shifts bits of a right by b positions. Result is 0 (binary 101 >> 3).

Conclusion:

The program successfully demonstrates the basic bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) and shifts (LEFT_SHIFT, RIGHT_SHIFT) in C++. Each operation's result is printed to the console, showcasing how these operations manipulate the bits of integer values a and b. The output matches the expected values based on binary arithmetic, confirming the correctness of the bitwise operations and shifts implemented in the program.
